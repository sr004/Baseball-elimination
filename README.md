# Baseball-elimination
In the baseball elimination problem, there is a league consisting of n teams. At some point during the season, team i has wi wins and gij games left to play against team j. A team is eliminated if it cannot possibly finish the season in first place or tied for first place. The goal is to determine exactly which teams are eliminated. The problem is not as easy as many sports writers would have you believe, in part because the answer depends not only on the number of games won and left to play, but also on the schedule of remaining games. In the 1960â€™s, Schwartz showed how to determine whether one particular team is eliminated using a maximum flow computation. This project implement the solution using maximum flow algorithm in python. We created this project as part of coursework for advanced algorithm course.
